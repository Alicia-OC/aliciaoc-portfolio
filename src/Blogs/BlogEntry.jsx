                        of what features the base of my app needed, so this

                      I usually need max 30min to solve a LeetCode problem,
                      well... boy oh boy was this a long ride {happy}. The
                      hardest leetcode problem Iâ€™ve done so far but I feel I
                      have gained a better understanding of how binary sums
                      work. I was only able to hit 8ms and 3 ms but Iâ€™m
                      satisfied for now. Funny that the top answer to this
                      problem solved it un just 2 lines XD.

                        I already studied binary a long time ago, at that time I
                        honestly felt I didn't understood a single thing, but
                        thanks to this problem I've realised my brain actually
                        asimilated some of the logic {happy}. Now I don't
                        struggle that much understanding the equivalent of
                        binaries!

                    Today was good! I was able to fix most of the navbar bugs,
                    it now collapses thanks to a toggle button and it's
                    responsive, so the navbar will close automatically if the
                    app detects that the screen is less than 760px! Claude help
                    me a bit {happy}. Overall I'm very happy with myself, I've
                    coded a lot and I haven't had that much help with the
                    Navbar. The tutorial gave me the basics but I ended up
                    following just half of the video and then continuing alone.

                    I Asked Claude for help with the blog layout. I love UI/UX
                    design but I've been working on this for longer than
                    expected, I though this would take me 2-3 days and it ended
                    up taking me 7, so I asked Claude to give me an html based
                    on a plain text with basic format (bold, italics, etc. I was
                    storing my blogs in a basic word doc)
