          Bootcamps are incredible for learning to build real applications
          quickly. But here's what I've observed time and again: they're so
          focused on hands-on coding that they often skip the essential
          vocabulary, definitions, and core computer science concepts that every
          developer should understand. You end up knowing how to build things
          without fully grasping the "why" behind them. The only way to truly
          fill these knowledge gaps is through readingâ€”diving into blogs,
          documentation, books, and technical articles that explain the
          fundamental concepts bootcamps don't have time to cover. <strong>Think of this
          blog as your cheatsheet and a cute and cosy documentation database!</strong>
