# 🚀 From CV to Portfolio: The Evolution

Originally, my GitHub Pages site was just meant to host my **CV** — a cleaner, more dynamic version of the usual PDF. But, as always, the more I coded, the more ideas started flowing... and the more ambitious I became.

> 💡 So I thought: **why not turn it into a full portfolio and add my own blog, a.k.a diary?**

## ⚠️ The Challenge

Now, there's a small catch — **GitHub Pages doesn't support a backend**. So I had to get creative. Right now, I'm adding blog posts in a pretty rudimentary way. I'm not entirely happy with it, to be honest.

### 🤔 Current Issues:

- **🔓 Too exposed** — the current setup lacks privacy controls
- **💾 Missing backend love** — I love coding the backend and working with databases, and this setup just doesn't scratch that itch
- **⚡ Manual maintenance** — maintaining blog posts manually is... _a lot_

## 🔮 Future Plans

Eventually, I plan to build a small tool for myself — something that takes **plain text** and transforms it into the **HTML** I need, with all the right classes and structure.

### ✨ Goals:

- [ ] Save time on blog formatting
- [ ] Focus on the fun part: **writing and building**
- [ ] Or even better... hosting it somewhere else that allows me to have a **backend and API calls**! 🎯
